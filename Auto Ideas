Please put all comments and ideas in these lines in between the symbols, thanks - Caleb H

Ideas:
- 4 distance reading sensors, two on each side of the robot, one sensor high and one sensor low. 
If program. If no sensors triggered do A, one sensor (lower one) triggered do B, and all sensors triggered do C
